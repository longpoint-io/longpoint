## Guidelines for building UI for the `@longpoint/admin` app
* Utilize the `@longpoint/ui` package for UI primitives when possible e.g. buttons, switches, dialogs, labels, inputs, checkboxes, etc.
* If the `@longpoint/ui` package does not contain a component you think could be a generic reusable one, check the shadcn component registry. If it exists, you can install it by running `npm run shad [some-component-1] [some-component-2]` from the root project workspace.
* Use kebab-case for react component file names. E.g. "my-component.tsx"
* Use the cn utility to join classes together (import { cn } from "@longpoint/ui/utils")

## Guidelines for core API
* When creating "update" counterparts to "create" dtos, try to use the PartialType utility

## Fullstack considerations
* When creating/updating API endpoints, run `npx nx build @longpoint/sdk` to regenerate the typescript client. You may then use the regenerated client when building Admin UI.
* If changing database schema, you may need to push the schema and regenerate types. Ask for confirmation to run `npx nx db:push core`
* The project is currently in a heavy development pre-alpha stage, breaking changes and schema changes are more encouraged (as of 12/3/2025)

## Conventions
* Avoid repetitive copy when possible (Heading: "Details", Subheading: "Details about the asset")
* Avoid overly verbose comments. Try to comment when code is less self-documenting
* Follow the entity/service pattern in the core package. Service orchestrates
