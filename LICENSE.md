# Longpoint Licensing

Longpoint is a multi-licensed project. Different packages have different licenses
to balance open source values with sustainable development.

## License Summary

### FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0 (Protected Packages)

The following packages are licensed under the Functional Source License 1.1
with Apache 2.0 as the future license. This means you can use them for any
purpose except offering them as a competing hosted/managed service. After two
years, they convert to the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

- `@longpoint/core` — See [packages/core/LICENSE.md](packages/core/LICENSE.md)
- `@longpoint/admin` — See [packages/admin/LICENSE.md](packages/admin/LICENSE.md)

### MIT License (Permissive Packages)

All other packages not explicitly outlined above are licensed under the MIT License.

## What This Means

✅ **Self-hosting:** You can freely self-host Longpoint for your own use.

✅ **Building plugins:** The devkit is MIT licensed, so you can build and distribute
plugins (open source or proprietary) without restriction.

✅ **Building apps:** The SDK and React packages are MIT licensed, so you can freely
integrate Longpoint into your applications.

❌ **Competing services:** You cannot use `@longpoint/core` or `@longpoint/admin`
to offer a competing managed Longpoint service.

## MIT License

The MIT License applies to all packages not explicitly licensed under FSL.
